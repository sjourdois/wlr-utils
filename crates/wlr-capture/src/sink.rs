//! Common output seam for capture-consuming tools (screenshot, record, timelapse).
//!
//! A capture round yields a [`Frame`] — CPU pixels (shm) or a GPU dma-buf
//! (zero-copy). A [`FrameSink`] consumes a stream of those frames. Most sinks only
//! want CPU pixels, so the default [`FrameSink::push_dmabuf`] reads the dma-buf back
//! via a [`GpuReadback`] and forwards to [`FrameSink::push`]; a GPU-native sink (a
//! future hardware video encoder, say) can override it to keep the buffer on the
//! GPU. [`pump`] routes a `Frame` to whichever path applies, creating the readback
//! lazily so pure-shm streams never spin up an EGL context.
