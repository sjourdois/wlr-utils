//! Native Wayland clipboard copy via `zwlr_data_control_v1` (the wlroots
//! clipboard-manager protocol, the same one `wl-copy` and `grim` use).
//!
//! [`serve`] offers a single blob under one MIME type and answers paste requests
//! until another client takes ownership of the selection. The Wayland clipboard is
//! *pull*-based: the data lives in the providing client, which must stay alive and
//! write the bytes whenever a consumer pastes. So this blocks for the lifetime of
//! the selection — callers that want their shell back should run it detached in the
//! background (see `wlr-shot`'s clipboard daemon).
//!
//! Only the `data-control` path is implemented: it needs no surface or input focus,
//! which suits a headless capture tool. The classic `wl_data_device` fallback
//! requires a focused surface and an input serial, so it is deliberately omitted —
//! every wlroots compositor we target exposes `data-control`.
