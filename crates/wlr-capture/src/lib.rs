//! `wlr-capture` — the reusable bricks behind the wlr-utils tools.
//!
//! Always available (headless-friendly, no egui/EGL display deps):
//! - [`wl`]: native Wayland client that enumerates foreign toplevels + outputs and
//!   captures them (full-resolution, zero-copy GPU dma-buf path) via
//!   `ext-image-copy-capture`.
//! - [`clipboard`]: put a captured blob on the wlroots clipboard (`data-control`).
//! - [`gl`]: EGL/GL dma-buf import + headless readback ([`gl::GpuReadback`]).
//! - [`sink`]: the [`sink::FrameSink`] seam shared by screenshot/record/timelapse,
//!   with GPU dma-buf readback under the default path.
//! - [`stream`]: the shared live-capture session driver (arm/poll/reopen/give-up),
//!   used by the mirror, recorder and change monitor.
//! - [`diff`]: a frame-difference metric for change detection.
//!
//! Behind the `compose` feature (resamples with `image`):
//! - [`capture`]: resolve a source (output/window/region) to a [`wl::CapturedImage`],
//!   compositing across mixed-scale outputs. Shared by `wlr-shot` and `wlr-peek`.
//!
//! Behind the `video` feature (links system FFmpeg via `ffmpeg-next`, headless):
//! - [`video`]: a [`sink::FrameSink`] that encodes a capture stream to a file with a
//!   pluggable hardware/software backend (NVENC / VAAPI / libx264).
//!
//! Behind the `focus` feature (compositor IPC, pulls `serde_json`):
//! - [`focus`]: "the active window" / "the current output" via the compositor's own
//!   IPC (Sway today). Wayland gives no portable way to query focus.
//!
//! This crate carries **no localised UI strings**: it exposes an API and typed
//! [`CaptureError`]s, and any on-screen text (e.g. the overlay hints, the mirror labels)
//! is passed in by the caller. Each tool crate owns its own catalog via `wlr-i18n`.
//!
//! Behind the `toolkit` feature (on by default) — the egui/EGL overlay toolkit:
//! - [`render`]: egui → `egui_glow` rendering on an EGL context bound to a surface.
//! - `icons` / `theme`: shared overlay UI helpers.
//!
//! Consumers (`wlr-chooser`, `wlr-pip`, …) build their own windowing host on top
//! and reuse this engine for the heavy lifting; a future headless recorder can use
//! the capture engine + readback without pulling in the toolkit.

// `doc_cfg` renders the "Available on crate feature X" badges on docs.rs (nightly-only,
// so guarded by the `docsrs` cfg that docs.rs sets via rustdoc-args).
#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]
// Keep the public API fully documented (the whole surface ships on docs.rs).
#![warn(missing_docs)]

// Re-exported so consumers can own a single `Connection` and pass it to several
// overlays in one process (e.g. the region selector then a live mirror), sharing one
// `EGLDisplay` instead of opening a second one. See `overlay::select_region_on`.
