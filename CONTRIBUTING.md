# Contributing to wlr-utils

Thanks for your interest! Bug reports, translations, themes and patches are all
welcome.

## The workspace

`wlr-utils` is a Cargo workspace. One library powers a handful of binaries:

| Crate | Binaries | What it is |
|-------|----------|------------|
| `wlr-capture` | — | the shared engine: wlroots capture (`ext-image-copy-capture-v1`, or `wlr-screencopy` for screens, dma-buf zero-copy + shm fallback) and the egui/EGL overlay toolkit |
| `wlr-i18n` | — | shared Fluent localisation plumbing; each tool builds its own catalog on it |
| `wlr-chooser` | `wlr-chooser`, `wlr-switcher`, `wlr-overlayd` | screen-share picker + Alt-Tab/exposé switcher, and the daemon that keeps their overlay warm |
| `wlr-shot` | `wlr-shot` | screenshots & recording |
| `wlr-peek` | `wlr-peek` | colour picker, loupe, mirror, OCR, grep, watch |
| `wlr-draw` | `wlr-draw` | on-screen annotation overlay |
| `wlr-utils` | `wlr-chooser`, `wlr-switcher`, `wlr-overlayd`, `wlr-peek`, `wlr-shot`, `wlr-draw` | bundle crate re-exporting every tool's binary (`cargo install wlr-utils`); kept out of `default-members` so a plain build doesn't clash on duplicate binary names |

## Building & checks

Build the default set (every tool, **not** the bundle), or a single tool with `-p`:

```sh
cargo build                       # all tools (default-members)
cargo build --release -p wlr-shot # just one tool
cargo build -p wlr-utils          # the bundle (re-exports the same binaries)
```

> Avoid `--workspace` for builds: it pulls in the `wlr-utils` bundle alongside the
> individual crates, and Cargo warns about the duplicate binary names. The default set
> excludes the bundle, so plain `cargo build` / `cargo test` stay clean; check the bundle
> on its own with `-p wlr-utils`.

Before opening a pull request, make these clean (CI runs the same):

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo build -p wlr-utils          # the bundle isn't in the default set
```

The engine has feature combinations worth checking when you touch it, e.g.
`cargo clippy -p wlr-capture --no-default-features --features overlay` (and
`mirror`, `compose`, `focus`, `pointer`, `keys`, `video`, `gpu`).

## Testing the overlays without disturbing your screen

The interactive tools are layer-shell overlays, so they cover your screen. To
iterate (and to regenerate the screenshots/videos), use the generator in
[`tools/screenshots`](tools/screenshots): it spins up an **isolated, headless
nested sway**, drives the tool with a synthetic pointer + keyboard and captures
the result — all without touching your real session.

```sh
cd tools/screenshots
./capture.sh draw          # build + run a single scene
./capture.sh               # regenerate every asset
```

See `tools/screenshots/README.md` for how it works.

## Translations

Each tool crate owns **its own** Fluent catalog under
`crates/<crate>/i18n/<lang>/<crate>.ftl` (domains `wlr_chooser`, `wlr_peek`,
`wlr_shot`, `wlr_draw`); the shared loader plumbing lives in the `wlr-i18n` crate,
and `wlr-capture` (the engine) carries no UI strings. To add a language to a tool,
copy its `en` catalog (e.g. `crates/wlr-draw/i18n/en/wlr_draw.ftl`), translate the
values — keep the `{ $name }` placeables and the message keys — and add the file.
The English catalog is the source of truth and the per-message fallback; CJK
renders via an auto-detected CJK font. CLI `--help` text stays English by design.

## Themes

A theme is a `theme.toml` of colours (and optional fonts), shared by the
overlays. Add new palettes to `docs/themes/`; the keys are documented in
`crates/wlr-capture/src/theme.rs`.

## Commit messages & license

Conventional-commit style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` …) is appreciated. By
contributing, you agree that your contributions are dual-licensed under
Apache-2.0 and MIT, the same terms as the project.

## Releasing

Cutting a release (the whole workspace versions as one block) follows a checklist
that catches the docs and CI files which drift after a structural change — see
[`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).
