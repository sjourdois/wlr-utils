## Unreleased

### Added

- **`wlr-shot`**: a new screen-capture binary (built on the shared `wlr-capture`
  engine). `wlr-shot screenshot` captures a full output (`-o`), a logical region
  (`-g "X,Y WxH"`, slurp-compatible, stitched across the outputs it covers), or a
  window (`-w ID` / `--pick-window` via `wlr-chooser`), the whole layout (`--all`),
  the active window (`-a`) or the focused output (`--current-output`), to
  PNG/JPEG/PPM (file or stdout); `--list-outputs` prints names and logical
  geometry. Single-output captures keep native resolution (incl. fractional
  scaling); multi-output regions composite at logical resolution. Focus-aware modes
  use compositor IPC via a small extensible backend (Sway today; Hyprland/niri
  next). `-s` opens an **interactive frozen region selector** — a layer-shell
  overlay per output showing the frozen screen; drag to select (spanning outputs),
  `Esc` cancels, `Enter` confirms — then crops from the same frozen pixels.
  `-c`/`--clipboard` copies the shot to the Wayland clipboard (wlroots
  `data-control`) instead of writing a file: a tiny daemon detaches to serve the
  selection until another client replaces it (`--clipboard-foreground` keeps it in
  the foreground).
- **`wlr-shot record`**: record a source to an H.264 video file (container from the
  extension, e.g. `.mp4`). Same sources as `screenshot` — output (`-o`/sole),
  `--current-output`, window (`-w`/`--pick-window`, follows it across workspaces and
  while occluded), `-a`, and a single-output region (`-g`/`-s`). Pluggable encoder
  (`--encoder auto|nvenc|vaapi|software`): `auto` prefers hardware (NVENC, then
  VAAPI on a `--device` render node) and falls back to software `libx264`. Capture is
  damage-driven, so a normal recording emits a constant frame rate at `--fps` (default
  30), repeating the last frame through static stretches; `--timelapse INTERVAL`
  instead samples one frame per interval and plays them at `--fps`, so the footage is
  sped up. Stops on `--duration SECS`, Ctrl-C (the file is finalised cleanly), or the
  window closing. Built on a new `wlr_capture::video` `FrameSink` (feature `video`,
  on by default; `--no-default-features` builds screenshots-only with no FFmpeg
  dependency).
- **`wlr-capture`** engine additions (foundations for the capture suite): accurate
  output geometry via `xdg-output` with a `wl_output` fallback (multi-monitor
  positions and fractional-scale logical sizes), one-shot capture
  (`capture_output_once` / `capture_toplevel_once`), a `Region` type with
  `CapturedImage::pixel` / `crop` / `blit_into` for cropping and multi-output
  compositing, and a `clipboard` module that puts a captured blob on the wlroots
  clipboard via `zwlr_data_control_v1`. New `gl::GpuReadback` reads a capture
  dma-buf back to CPU RGBA8 through a headless offscreen EGL context (1×1 pbuffer +
  `glReadPixels`), so the GPU path can feed CPU encoders. New `sink::FrameSink` is
  the common output seam for screenshot/record/timelapse, with `sink::pump` routing
  shm frames straight through and reading dma-buf frames back via `GpuReadback`
  (built lazily, so pure-shm streams never spin up EGL). The crate now splits into
  an always-on core (`wl`, `clipboard`, `gl`, `sink`) and a `toolkit` feature (on by
  default) gating the egui/EGL overlay UI (`render` + `theme`/`i18n`/`icons`) — a
  headless build (`--no-default-features`) drops egui, resvg, fontdb and the i18n
  stack for a ~6× smaller dependency tree. `wlr-shot` gains an off-by-default `gpu`
  feature that builds the dma-buf capture path and reads frames back before
  encoding (the shipped binary stays shm-only, no `libgbm`).

- **`wlr-switcher`**: a new binary — a live window switcher / Alt-Tab / exposé that
  **focuses** the picked window (via `zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1`). Bind it
  to a held modifier for a true Alt-Tab (`bindsym Mod1+Tab exec wlr-switcher`): the
  overlay appears while the modifier (Alt **or** Super) is held, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`
  cycle, and **releasing the modifier** confirms and switches. Three presentations
  via `--layout strip|grid|card`:
  - `strip` (default) — a macOS-style single row of tiles, highlighted window's
    name above; each tile shows a **live preview** with the app icon as a badge
    (live capture being the differentiator);
  - `grid` — the full-screen mission-control exposé;
  - `card` — the centred rofi-like card.
  Live previews are tunable with `--live none|current|all` (default `all`).
  Hold-to-switch is on by default for `strip`, off for `grid`/`card`; force it with
  `--hold` / `--no-hold`. Mouse click and `Esc` still work; only one switcher opens
  at a time. It uses the `keyboard-shortcuts-inhibit` protocol so the compositor
  forwards the full chord (e.g. `Mod1+Tab`) to the overlay instead of re-running its
  binding — this is what lets `Tab` cycle forward under Sway and other wlroots
  compositors. App icons are loaded at higher resolution to stay crisp, and the
  exposé intro animation is skipped while hold-to-switch is armed for an instant
  first frame.

### Changed

- **`wlr-chooser`** is now strictly the xdg-desktop-portal-wlr picker (prints the
  chosen source to stdout). The window-switcher modes (`--switch` / `--alt-tab`)
  moved to the new `wlr-switcher` binary. Both binaries ship from the same package
  and share the capture engine.
- The overlay now starts capturing before building itself, so thumbnails stream in
  sooner. Set `WLR_CHOOSER_TIMING=1` to print cold-start timing milestones to
  stderr.

## 1.2.0

### Added

- **`wlr-pip`**: a new companion binary — a floating, always-on-top live mirror
  (picture-in-picture) of a single window, sharing the same zero-copy GPU capture
  engine. Pick a window via `wlr-chooser` (run `wlr-pip` with no argument) or pass
  its identifier (`wlr-pip <id>`). It is an `xdg-toplevel` (pair with Sway
  `floating enable, sticky enable` for always-on-top across workspaces): drag to
  move, corner grip to resize (source aspect ratio kept), hover for collapse/close,
  `Esc` to quit. Collapsed to an icon badge, it pops back open when its window
  changes. One mirror per window (single-instance lock per identifier). Keyboard
  shortcuts: `Space` freeze/unfreeze, `c` collapse, `+`/`-` or wheel for opacity,
  `r` re-pick another window, `q`/`Esc` close.

### Changed

- The project is now a Cargo **workspace**: a shared `wlr-capture` library (the
  wlroots capture engine + the egui/EGL rendering & dma-buf-import toolkit, both
  extracted from the previous single crate) plus the `wlr-chooser` and `wlr-pip`
  binaries. No behaviour change for `wlr-chooser`.

## 1.1.0

### Added

- **Live thumbnails**: previews now refresh continuously (damage-driven), so the
  grid shows windows updating in real time, including on other workspaces.
- **GPU zero-copy capture** behind the `gpu` Cargo feature (on by default):
  dma-bufs are allocated via gbm and imported as GL textures (EGLImage), with no
  CPU read-back. Falls back to the CPU shm path automatically when unavailable.
  Build without it (no gbm/`libgbm` dependency) via `--no-default-features`.
- **`--switch`** window switcher: a live alt-tab / exposé that **focuses** the
  picked window (via `zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1`) instead of printing.
  Two presentations via `--layout`: `full` (full-screen mission-control grid that
  dims the desktop, with an intro animation — default) or `compact` (the centred
  card). Identical windows are disambiguated by creation order so the right one
  is focused. Only one switcher opens at a time (re-pressing the keybind is a
  no-op, via a single-instance lock).

## 1.0.0
